package com.rev.packages;

public class Packages {
    // if I wanted to access this class somewhere else in my code I could do so by utilizing its fully qualified name:
    // com.rev.packages.Packages

    // it is much easier to import classes than it is to constantly reference them by their fully qualified name, so we
    // use the import keyword. Importing this class would look like this: import com.rev.packages.Packages

    // please use your imports, only use fully qualified names when absolutely necessary: you will save yourself time
    // and many headaches.
