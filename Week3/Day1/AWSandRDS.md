## AWS RDS
Amazon Web Service offers Relational Database Services (RDS). Relational Databases are useful when you need to associate data (think columns and rows). Relational Databases are also useful when you need to link data between one or more related tables (think food and food groups, players and teams, etc.).

Using Amazon's RDS we will create a database that can store data for our projects. We are using Amazon because they provide many quality of life services alongside their RDS:
1. AWS manages backups for us
2. They handle software updates
3. Auto failure detection
4. They offer recovery options
