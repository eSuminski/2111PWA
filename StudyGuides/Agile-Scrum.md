## Agile Introduction
Agile is not a framework or architecture for programming: it is a development mindset. There are four core tennants of the agile mindset:
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

There are many different ways of implementing Agile development, we will focus on using Scrum
## Scrum
Scrum is an iterative way of doing software development that promotes an Agile mindset. There are four different roles in a Scrum:
1. Stakeholder
    - the stakeholder is the individual or company the product is for
    - Bank of America, AT@T, some dude who hired your team, etc
2. Product Holder
    - the representative of the stakeholder
    - this is the go-to person when you have questions, need clarification, or have updates on the product
3. Scrum Leader
    - individual who is in charge of the scrum team
    - generally a techincally skilled individual (think lead developer)
    - their primary goal is to help the team work at a high level
        - they encourage the team
        - assist in debugging
        - interact with client
        - help with communication between teammates
4. Scrumlings (team members)
    - developers
    - devops
    - buisness analysts (help with user stories and communicate with product holder)

Scrums usually work in two to three week sprints. A sprint is a single iteration on a software project, and it has a few "ceremonies" that go along with it:
1. User Story Grooming
    - first event of the sprint
    - User stories and acceptance criteria are created in this ceremony
    - Then story pointing happens
        - this is where difficulty is assigned to user stories
    - finally user stories are assigned to different individuals/teams
2. Daily Standup
    - Team members discuss what they are working on each day
        - discuss progress
        - discuss blockers (development progress)
        - offer help for blockers
3. Sprint Retrospective
    - done at the end of the sprint
    - discuss what went well
    - discuss what did not go well
    - plan for next sprint
