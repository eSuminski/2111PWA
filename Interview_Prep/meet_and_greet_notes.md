### General Notes
This meeting is a chance for you to learn more about Cognizant and for them to get to know you more. The meeting is a great time to ask about the company, life of a tester with the company, opportunities in the company, questions of this nature. It is not an appropriate time to ask HR related questions. HR related questions are things like "when will I need to relocate?", "what will I be paid?" "I have a problem with person x, will I need to work with them?" Stick to questions related to the work during this meet and greet.
