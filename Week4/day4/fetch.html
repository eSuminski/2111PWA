    // Asynchronous Programming and JavaScript
/*
JavaScript is an event-driven language: you do NOT want to block the event que. While the que is blocked, NOTHING
else will happen until the event is completed. This can happen if you have an event that takes a LONG time to finish.

To get around this, many methods will return a promise object to free up the event que. This promise object is an empty object
that will eventually hold the data you expect when it becomes available
*/

// to make a function asyncronous you add the async keyword to the function declaration

async function getUser(){
    const user = await sendUserInfo(username, password);
}

// order of operations
/*
    promise is created
    code continues to run
    promise is replaced by actual data when it is available
*/

// it is common to use async await with the fetch api. The fetch api is built in to browsers and allows for the creation of
// http requests

// const response = await fetch(url, {method:"POST", body:"usually a json"});
// const body = await response.json();
