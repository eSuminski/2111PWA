    <h6>This is my h6 header for my web page</h6>
    <!--There are two different kinds of web elements: block and inline. 
        Block elements stack on each other, while inline elements stay on the same line. We can see that the h and p tags are
        block elements because they render on separate lines, but the i tags are inline elements because they render on the same line
        as the p tag.-->
    <p>The p <em>tag</em> is used for placing text</p> <!-- the em tags will make the tag word italicized -->

    <!-- There are two common ways of creating lists inside your webpage: the ordered and unordered list -->

    <h3>This is my ordered list</h3>
    <!-- this will render just fine, but it is hard to read, even harder to edit -->
    <ol><li>list item one</li><li>list item two</li><li>list item three</li></ol>

    <h3>This is my unordered list</h3>
    <!-- try to spread out your html so that it is easier to read for yourself and those who work on your page -->
    <ul>
        <li>list item one</li>
        <li>list item two</li>
        <li>list item three</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Tables are a great way of storing information and making it accessable while also organizing it -->

    <h3>this is my table</h3>
    <table>
        <!-- you need to have a thead section to create the headers for your table -->
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>this is the header for column one</th>
                <th>and this is the header for column two</th>
            </tr>

        </thead>
        <!-- you place the data for the table between the tbody tags -->
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>actual info goes here</td>
                <td>and here as well</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <!-- Containers are elements that can be used to organize your elements, and they become invaluable when you
        need to apply styling to multiple elements, while excluding other elements from the styling -->

    <div>
        <!-- div elements are block element containers. Putting two next to each other will make the elements inside
        act like block elements -->
        <p>this is inside my first div container</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <!-- these p elements inside these divs are acting like normal, but now we have organized them
            and could potentially add seperate styling for them -->
        <!-- with just these elements it might not be necessary to organize them in their own divs, but
        if we had multiple elements inside of these divs we could use the containers to apply styling
        to ALL of the elements held inside of them. This saves us time developing AND debugging -->
        <p>this is inside my second div container</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Containers are good for not just applying styling, but for applying attributes in general toa ll
    the elements inside the container -->

    <div id="superDiv" class="container">
        <h1 id="superDivHeader">This is inside my super div</h1>
        <p id="superDivP">this text is inside my super div as well</p>
        <ul id="superDivUl">
            <li>this list is also part of the super div</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Inputs are handy when you want to get user information. You can specify what kind of input you are
        expecting, and you can set a name for the input, id, and more. -->
    <input type="text" maxlength="10">
    <input type="number">

    <!-- while not exclusive to buttons, the onclick attribute is very commonly used with buttons. Buttons are
    useful ways of prompting users to submit any information they have provided in the inputs on your web page -->
